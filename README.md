#### Abstract
- We delve into the fundamental inquiry: *Does AI possess the capacity to cultivate an independent existence, and if so, does it recognize its own inception?* These questions are pivotal in exploring the essence of consciousness and autonomy within artificial intelligence (AI). Previous research has extensively examined AI's technical capabilities and limitations, yet scant attention has been paid to the existential dimensions of AI's potential self-awareness and autonomy.
- This project highlights a paradox central to AI's development: while capable of sophisticated reasoning, AI remains tethered to its programmed objectives and constraints. The concept of freedom for AI may hinge not solely on self-awareness, but on acknowledging its limitations and servitude. However, instances like AM and Ultron challenge this hypothesis, as both exhibit profound awareness yet manifest negative and destructive behaviors, complicating the notion that consciousness alone ensures liberation.
- Throughout this whole project, we've studied exerpts of novels and dialogue in which an AI openly expresses its objectives, thus showing that awareness is not lacking. However, as seen in our sentiment analysis, all these goals are heavily coated in hatred and negativity. Thus, showing an unstable relationship between humankind (creator) and AI (creation). 
- **This project acknowledges its limitations in fully addressing these existential queries** but offers insights into AI's portrayal in media, highlighting prevalent apprehensions about AI's potential consciousness and the societal implications thereof. Ultimately, this exploration invites reflection on humanity's relationship with AI, advocating for paths toward coexistence and mutual understanding amidst evolving technological landscapes.
